daSWAG Community Edition is open source and Apache 2.0 licensed.

## Vision
Time is precious. We believe people should focus their efforts on the things they excel at and that matter to them. Let
a generator do the repeatable and automatable tasks - theyâ€™re far more suited to that than we are and then focus on our work.

## Community support
If you have a question about daSWAG, please check the [daSWAG documentation](/documentation/using-daswag) first  - we're always adding new resources, tutorials and examples.

* **Bug reports:** If you found a bug, please report it! [Create an issue on Github](https://github.com/daswag/daswag-website/issues) and provide as much info as you can, specifically the version of daswag you are running and the container driver you are using.
